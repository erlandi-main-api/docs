# Pipelines

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';

## Overview

The pipeline is the configuration unit. Each pipeline is encoded as a YAML file. 

By default, Semaphore will look for the first pipeline in the path `.semaphore/semaphore.yml` relative to the root of your repository. More pipelines can be chained using [promotions](#promotions) to create complex *workflows*.

For reference, here is an example pipeline with its respective YAML.

## Job execution order {#dependencies}

A pipeline is a group of [blocks](./jobs#blocks) connected by dependencies. Semaphore will automatically compute the execution graph based on the declared block dependencies.

In the following example:

- Block B and C depend on Block A. So, Block B and C won't start until all Block A is done. 
- Block D only starts when Block B AND Block C have finished.

![Pipeline execution order](./img/pipeline-execution-order.jpg)

<details>
 <summary>What if we removed all dependencies?</summary>
 <div>If we removed dependencies between blocks then all of them would run in parallel. 
 Functionally, it would be the same as having all jobs in one big block</div>
</details>

## Pipeline settings {#settings}

Pipeline settings are applied to all jobs it contains. You can change pipeline settings with the editor or directly in the YAML.

### Agents {#agents}

<Available/>

Agents are the environment where jobs run. Semaphore keeps a pool of warm agents at all times to be sure there's always one ready to work.

Semaphore Cloud provides the following agent types:
- *Linux Machines* presented as VMs or [Docker containers](#docker-environments)
- *Apple macOS Machines*

:::info

You can register additional machines as agents for your organization by *installing self-hosted agents*.

:::

To select the agent running your jobs by default:

<Tabs groupId="editor-yaml">
<TabItem value="editor" label="Editor">

1. Select the pipeline
2. Select the "Environment Type": Linux, Mac, or Docker
3. Select the "Operating System" version
4. Select the *machine type*

The available hardware changes depending on the type of environment you selected.

![Agent Selection](./img/agent-settings.jpg)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yaml" label="YAML">

1. Add the `agent` and `machine` keys
2. Add the hardware `type`. The value must be one of the supported *machine types*
3. Add the `os_image`. Value must be one of the supported *operating systems*

```yaml title=".semaphore/semaphore.yml"
version: v1.0
name: Initial Pipeline
# highlight-start
agent:
  machine:
    type: e1-standard-2
    os_image: ubuntu2004
# highlight-end
blocks:
  - name: 'Block #1'
    dependencies: []
    task:
      agent:
        machine:
          type: e1-standard-2
          os_image: ubuntu2004
      jobs:
        - name: 'Job #1'
          commands:
            - checkout
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Docker containers {#docker-environments}

Jobs can run inside Docker containers. This allows you to define a custom-build environment with pre-installed tools and dependencies needed for your project.

You can run multiple containers at the same time. The job will run in the first container (called `main`) and connect the rest of the containers to the same network. You can reach the other containers using their names as DNS records are injected into the main container.


:::tip

If you want to build and run Docker images in your jobs, check the *working with Docker Images documentation*.

:::

To run the job inside a Docker container:

<Tabs groupId="editor-yaml">
<TabItem value="editor" label="Editor">

1. Select the pipeline
2. In "Environment Types" select "Docker Container(s)"
3. Select the *machine type*
4. Type the name of the container
5. Optionally, add environment variables
6. Optionally, add more containers

![Setting Docker environments](./img/agent-docker.jpg)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yaml" label="YAML">

1. Add the `agent` and `machine`
2. Add a `containers` key
3. Each list item is a container. The first one must be called `main`
4. Add the `image`
5. Optionally add more containers

```yaml title=".semaphore/semaphore.yml"
version: v1.0
name: Initial Pipeline
# highlight-start
agent:
  machine:
    type: e1-standard-2
    os_image: ubuntu2004
  containers:
    - name: main
      image: 'semaphoreci/ubuntu:20.04'
    - name: web
      image: nginx
# highlight-end
blocks:
  - name: 'Block #1'
    dependencies: []
    task:
      agent:
        machine:
          type: e1-standard-2
          os_image: ubuntu2004
      jobs:
        - name: 'Job #1'
          commands:
            - 'curl http://web'
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::warning

Due to the introduction of [Docker Hub rate limits](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/ci-cd-environment/docker-authentication/), Semaphore will automatically redirect any pulls from the semaphoreci Docker Hub repository to the *Semaphore Container Registry*.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


The pipeline settings are:

1. **Agent**: the *agent environment* where the jobs in the pipeline will run â€” [unless overriden](./jobs#agent-override).
2. **Machine Type**: the hardware where the jobs run. Semaphore Cloud provides several *machine types* out of the box. You can add more types using *self-hosted agents*.
3. **Prologue**: similar to the [block prologue](./jobs#prologue), these commands will be prepended to the job commands in the pipeline.
4. **Epilogue**: like the [block epilogue](./jobs#epilogue), these commands will be appended to the job commands in the pipeline. You add commands that are executed when the job passes, fails, or always runs.
5. **Execution time limit**: time limit for job execution. Defaults to 1 hour. Any jobs running longer than this limit will be forcibly stopped.
6. **Fail-fast**: defines what to do when a job fails. Here you can configure the Semaphore to stop all running jobs as soon as one fails or set custom behaviors.
7. **Auto-cancel**: define what happens if changes are pushed to the repository while a pipeline is running. By default, Semaphore will queue these runs. You can, for example, stop the current pipeline and run the newer commits instead.
8. **YAML file path**: you can override where the pipeline config file is located in your repository.


### After pipeline jobs {#after-pipeline-job}

You can configure jobs to run once a pipeline stops, even if it ended due to a failure, stopped, or canceled.

After-pipeline jobs are executed in parallel. Typical use cases for after-pipeline jobs are sending notifications, collecting [test reports](./test-reports), or submitting metrics to an external server.

You can add after-pipeline jobs using YAML or the editor.

<Tabs groupId="editor-yaml">
<TabItem value="editor" label="Editor">

1. Press **+Add After Jobs**
2. Type the name of the job
3. Add your commands
4. Optionally, you can add more jobs
5. To delete them, click the X next to the job

![Adding an after pipeline job with the visual editor](./img/after-pipeline.jpg)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yaml" label="YAML">

1. Add `after_pipeline` key at the top level of the YAML.
2. Create a `task.jobs` key
3. Add the list of jobs with `name` and `commands`

  task:
    jobs:
      - name: Submit metrics
        commands:
          - 'export DURATION_IN_MS=$((SEMAPHORE_PIPELINE_TOTAL_DURATION * 1000))'
          - 'echo "ci.duration:${DURATION_IN_MS}|ms" | nc -w 3 -u statsd.example.com'
# highlight-end
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Connecting pipelines {#promotions}

:::tip

You can run pipelines without promotions with [tasks](./tasks)

:::

Your repository can contain more than one pipeline. We use *promotions* to tie pipelines together. Promotions define which pipelines should run next.

![How jobs are organized into blocks which are organized into pipelines. Pipelines can trigger other pipelines using promotions](./img/pipeline-blocks-promotions.jpg)

Using promotions we can create a tree-like structure where pipelines branch off other pipelines. The root of the tree is the default pipeline located at `.semaphore/semaphore.yml` (relative to the repository's root.

![A workflow with 3 pipelines](./img/workflows.jpg)

Promoted pipelines are typically used for continuous delivery and continuous deployment. The following example shows the initial pipeline branching into two continuous delivery pipelines: production and development. In each of these two, we define the sequence of [jobs](./jobs) needed to deploy the application in the respective environment.

### Promotion triggers

When a promotion is triggered the child pipeline starts to run. There are three options for triggering a promotion:

- **Manual promotions**: the default. Start the next pipeline by pressing a button.
- **Auto promotions**: start on certain conditions such as when all tests have passed on the "master" branch.
- **Parameterized promotions**: pass values as environment variables into the next pipelines. Allows us to reuse the same pipeline configuration for different tasks.

### How to add promotions

Promotions are defined in the pipeline from which the child pipelines branch off.

<Tabs groupId="editor-yaml">
<TabItem value="editor" label="Editor">

1. Press **+Add Promotion** 
2. Set a descriptive name for the promotion
3. Configure the new pipeline and add jobs as needed

![Adding a manual promotion](./img/promotion-add-manual.jpg)

Press (A) "Delete Promotion" to completely delete the promotion and *all child pipelines*.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yaml" label="YAML">

1. Create a new pipeline file in the `.semaphore` folder, e.g. `deploy.yml`
2. Edit the pipeline from which the new one (from step 1) branches off, e.g. `semaphore.yml` 
3. Add the `promotions` key at the root level of the YAML
4. Type the `name` of the promotion
5. Type the `pipeline_file` filename of the pipeline created in step 1.

```yaml title=".semaphore/semaphore.yml"
version: v1.0
name: Initial Pipeline
agent:
  machine:
    type: e1-standard-2
    os_image: ubuntu2004
blocks:
  - name: 'Block #1'
    dependencies: []
    task:
      agent:
        machine:
          type: e1-standard-2
          os_image: ubuntu2004
      jobs:
        - name: 'Job #1'
          commands:
            - checkout
            - make build
# highlight-start
promotions:
  - name: Promotion 1
    pipeline_file: deploy.yml
# highlight-end
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Automatic promotions

Automatic promotions start a pipeline on user-defined conditions.

After [adding a promotion](#promotions), you can set automatic conditions. Whenever Semaphore detects these conditions are fulfilled the child pipeline will automatically start.

<Tabs groupId="editor-yaml">
<TabItem value="editor" label="Editor">

1. Open the promotion you wish to autostart
2. Enable the checkbox **Enable automatic promotion**
3. Type in the *start conditions*

![Setting autostart conditions on a promotion](./img/promotion-auto.jpg)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yaml" label="YAML">

1. Open the pipeline file containing the promotion you wish to autostart
2. Add an `auto_promote` key
3. Add a child `when` key. Type in the *start conditions*

```yaml title=".semaphore/semaphore.yml"
version: v1.0
name: Initial Pipeline
agent:
  machine:
    type: e1-standard-2
    os_image: ubuntu2004
blocks:
  - name: 'Block #1'
    dependencies: []
    task:
      agent:
        machine:
          type: e1-standard-2
          os_image: ubuntu2004
      jobs:
        - name: 'Job #1'
          commands:
            - checkout
            - make build
promotions:
  - name: Promotion 1
    pipeline_file: deploy.yml
    # highlight-start
    auto_promote:
      when: branch = 'master' AND result = 'passed'
    # highlight-end
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Parameterized promotions {#parameters}

Parameterized promotions allow you to propagate environment variables on all jobs in the next pipeline. 

Use parameters to reduce the amount of pipeline duplication. For example, if you create a parametrized pipeline that reads the target environment from a variable, you can reuse it to deploy an application to production and testing environments. Parameters work with [manual](#how-to-add-promotions) and [automatic](#automatic-promotions) promotions.


### How to add parameters

To add parameters to a promotion, follow these steps:

<Tabs groupId="editor-yaml">
<TabItem value="editor" label="Editor">

1. Press the promotion you wish to add parameters to
2. Click **+Add Environment Variable**
    <details>
        <summary>Show me</summary>
        <div>
        ![Add parameter to promotion](./img/parameter-1.jpg)
        </div>
    </details>
3. Set the variable name 
4. Set an optional description
5. Set optional valid options. Leave blank to input value as freeform text
6. Enable the "This is a required parameter" checkbox if the parameter is mandatory
7. Set a default value (only when the parameter is mandatory)
8. Add more parameters as needed
    <details>
        <summary>Show me</summary>
        <div>
        ![Setting up parameters](./img/parameter-2.jpg)
        </div>
    </details>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yaml" label="YAML">

1. Edit the file where you wish to add the parameters
2. Add a `parameters.env_vars` key
3. Every list item is a new parameter. Set the `name` of the environment variable
4. Type an optional `description`
5. Optionally set `required` to `true|false`
6. Optionally set `options`. Each item in the list is a valid option. Leave blank to input value as freeform text
7. If `required: true`, set the `default_value`. Optional parameters don't have a default value

```yaml title=".semaphore/semaphore.yml"
# ...
promotions:
 - name: Deploy
   pipeline_file: deploy.yml
   # highlight-start
   parameters:
     env_vars:
       - required: true
         options:
           - Stage
           - Production
         default_value: Stage
         description: Where to deploy?
         name: ENVIRONMENT
   # highlight-end
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info

When a pipeline is triggered with [automatic promotions](#automatic-promotions) the parameter values are automatically filled following these rules:

- Mandatory parameters use the default value
- Optional parameters are left blank

:::

### Promoting with the UI

Once you have [added a parameter](#how-to-add-parameters), you can select its value from the Semaphore UI.

1. Press the promotion button
2. Select or type in the value. Optional parameters can be left blank
3. Press **Start promotion**

<TabItem value="freeform" label="Freeform type value">

![Typing the parameter value in freeform](./img/promotion-freeform.jpg)

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Promoting with the API

<Available/>

You can pass parameter values to the promotion when it is triggered using the *Semaphore API*.

The following is an example of a curl call that includes parameters:

```shell
curl -H "Authorization: Token {api_token}" \
 -d "name={promotion_name}&pipeline_id={parent_pipeline_id}&{param_1_name}={param_1_value}&{param_2_name}={param_2_value}" \
 -X POST "https://{org_name}.semaphoreci.com/api/v1alpha/promotions"
```

### Accessing parameters in jobs

Parameters are exported as [environment variables](./jobs#environment-variables) in all the jobs contained in the promoted pipeline.

You can access the parameter value by directly using the environment variable in your commands.

<Tabs groupId="editor-yaml">
<TabItem value="editor" label="Editor">

![Using parameters a environment variables in jobs](./img/parameters-jobs.jpg)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yaml" label="YAML">

The parameters are accessible are regular environment variables in the `commands` section.

```yaml title="deploy.yml"
version: v1.0
name: Deployment pipeline
agent:
  machine:
    type: e1-standard-2
    os_image: ubuntu2004
blocks:
  - name: Deploy
    task:
      jobs:
        - name: Deploy
          commands:
            # highlight-next-line
            - echo "Deploy to $ENVIRONMENT"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


### Accessing parameters in pipeline 

You can access parameter values in pipeline elements like the pipeline name.

Parameters can be accessed in the pipeline configuration using the `${{parameters}}` namespace. For example, if you defined a parameter called `ENVIRONMENT`, you can read its value in the pipeline config as:

```shell
${{parameters.ENVIRONMENT}}
```

Parameters are available in the following places:

- Pipeline `name`
- Pipeline *queue name* (only available via YAML)
- As the name of a [secret](./jobs#secrets) (only available in YAML)
