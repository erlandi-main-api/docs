# Organizations

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

The fist time you log in to Semaphore you'll be prompted to create an *organization*. An organization is the basic unit of administration. 

All organizations have a name, a [billing plan](https://semaphoreci.com/pricing), one or more administrators and collaborators, and settings to manage how to run your [pipelines](./pipelines).

## How to change organizations

To view or create other organizations, open the organization menu on the top right corner and select **Change Organization**.
