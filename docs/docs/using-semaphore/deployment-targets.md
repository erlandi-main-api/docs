# Deployment Targets


WIP

Deployment target

https://docs.semaphoreci.com/essentials/deployment-targets/

Deployment Targets allow you to apply strict conditions for who can start individual pipelines and under which conditions. Using them, you have the ability to control who has the ability to start specific promoted pipelines or select git references (branches and tags).

Combining the functionality of promotions and Deployment Targets gives you a full toolset to configure secure Continuous Deployment pipelines. This is backwards compatible with your previous setup.

The core advantage of using Deployment Targets is multi-faceted access control, i.e. taking many factors into account while granting the right to promote. Moreover, they are backed with a dedicated secret, unique per Deployment Target and inaccessible to outside Deployments. Last but not least, Deployment Targets give you a clear overview of your previous deployments, so you can see which version was shipped and by whom.
